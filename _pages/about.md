**Wonjun Park** is a Master of Science candidate in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Arlington (expected May 2026).

Over the past few years, he has built a strong foundation in machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence, and software engineering through various projects. As a visiting scholar at Purdue University, he designed and implemented a deep learning pipeline to classify Poison Ivy plants in nature. He also spearheaded EEG and fMRI projects such as EEG-based visual image reconstruction and 3D brain pathology visualization.

Wonjun joined [Arlington Computational Linguistic Lab](https://uta-acl2.github.io) in February 2025 and has been advised by [Dr. Kenny Q. Zhu](https://kenzhu2000.github.io/). He has recently focused on sound separation tasks with deep learning techniques, taking advantage of his previous backgrounds. He is strongly eager to apply his multidisciplinary knowledge to real-world challenges using AI technologies.
